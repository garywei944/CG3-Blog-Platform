                We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by
                their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
                Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
                powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive
                of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
                Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to
                them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
                that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
                accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
                sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when
                a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to
                reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
                Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient
                sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
                former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of
                repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute
                Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
